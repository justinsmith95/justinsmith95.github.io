                    The first week I really didn't know what to expect, but I'm glad to be beginning my bootcamp
                    journey.
                    I'm very excited to learn more about github, as it seems like it has a wide variety of tools and
                    uses.
                    I've been enjoying the learning process so far. The image I posted is of Yusuke Urameshi, the main
                    character in a show I like.

                <p> This week I've been learning a lot about HTML and CSS, their purposes and how they interact with
                    each other. The project this week, specifically, has been very fulfilling in that I feel I can
                    actually create a page and make meaningful changes to it, and be able to see those changes take
                    effect. I'm excited to learn more ways to change and add different objects and elements through
                    html, css, and js as well.
                    I wish I were able to read the code that we've been exposed to already (as well as code we haven't)
                    much more efectively and quickly. Right now even with html, looking at a page of code feels pretty
                    foreign and I have a hard time understanding what each line or tool's purpose is in the code, but I
                    think this skill will improve with practice.
                    I'm currently still struggling a bit with github, in that I still feel quite unfamiliar with the
                    commands and terminology. I think that these weekly blog posts will help in this, however, as I'll
                    have at least a once weekly refresher/review on github when working on the blog posts.
                    Right now when I'm trying to solve a problem(something not working as intended), my first step is to
                    start at the beginning and try to look over each piece for what is needed and what I've input so far
                    for any glaring mistakes (sometimes my typing mistakes I have a hard time catching). Then I'll try
                    to form a clear statement of what task I'm currently trying to accomplish, so I know I have an idea
                    of what to look for in a solution. I'm typically quick to google search any misunderstanding or
                    immediate questions that may arise when I encounter a problem.
                    If I'm not able to search up a solution, I like to take a break and try and come back to the problem
                    with (hopefully) a fresh view and ideally notice something I was missing by tunnel vision earlier.

                <p> Missed a lot of time due to illness and feeling a bit behind. Struggling somewhat with javascript
                    but slowly learning. Feels like I'm understanding Github moreso than before. I'm curious to see what
                    level of overlap there is between the functions of HTML, CSS, and javascript. How many tasks will be
                    unique to only one of these? As for pseudocoding, I'm interested in the concept. It reminds me of
                    rough drafting for essays. I'm typically not very good at executing a full draft phase before
                    starting work, and sometimes this probably leads to mistakes that could have been avoided with more
                    pre-planning; so I'm hoping I can hone pseudocoding as a useful skill.

Blog Post 9
A CLI  allows us to give commands that would (without it) probably require a lot more time, effort, and typing. I don't think I have much of an idea of what all CLIs are capable of, so in that way they can be a bit scary. 
If I were to build a CLI, I would use it to make typing typical commands we use every day shorter and easier to use repeatedly. Most notably the git add, commit and push; and more recently the yarn build and firebase deploy, into single word commands. I'm sure there is much more complex action that can be built into a CLI, however. Without  a framework (React in this case) since I've been using hooks, I can see how using classes takes more code and therefore time to create. The snippets also allow for faster coding.
